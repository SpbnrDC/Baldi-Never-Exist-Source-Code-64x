THANK YOU FOR PLAYING BALDI NEVER EXIST! THE FIRST EDUTAINMENT TITLE THAT TEACHES FUN!


Installation:
1. Extract the game files out of the .zip file. The game will not work while inside the .zip.
2. Make sure all of the files contained within the original .zip are all within the same folder. This folder can be stored anywhere on your PC.
3. Activate "BALDI.EXE" to run the game.


Resolution and window settings:
In order to change the game's resolution and window settings, you must hold "SHIFT" when launching the game. This will load the settings window.

**WARNING!** DO NOT CHANGE THE INPUT SETTINGS FOUND IN THIS WINDOW! ONLY CHANGE CONTROLS WITH THE IN-GAME CONTROLS MENU!


Game settings:
Turn sensitivity - Adjusts the speed at which you can turn. Adjust if the turning feels too slow or too fast.
Controls - Access a control mapper. You can rebind controls to the keyboard, mouse, and a controller.
Rumble - Check this if you want your controller to rumble while playing the game. Only works with controllers that support rumble.
Analog movement - Check this if you wish to have analog movement while using a controller. If unchecked, you will always move at the same speed no matter how far you move the stick from the center. Note: While running, analog movement is always off and speed is always maxed.


Troubleshooting:
Q: The game won't launch and a pop-up saying "Windows protected your PC" comes up.
A: Click "More info" and then click "Run anyway" to continue.

Q: There is an error about a .dll that could not be found. What do I do?
A: Make sure you have extracted all of the games files and are running the game from the folder, not the .zip file. Furthermore, make sure all of the files are in the same folder as the application. If any are missing, the game will not run.

Q: The game still will not run and I've made sure I've followed all the above advice. What now?
A: Go to the game's compatibility settings and check "Run as administrator." Another thing to try is going to the game's resolution settings dialog (Explained above) and changing the "Windowed" setting. These may not make a difference, but are worth a shot.


Baldi's Tips'n'Tricks'n'Lessons:
Hi, it's me, Baldi! Here are some great tips that will surely help you complete my game!

I heard that! - I can hear almost any sound you make! To beat me at hide and seek, you'll have to keep that in mind when opening doors or making other noises.

Follow the rules... but only when the Principal is near! - It's always the right thing to follow your school's rules, but not in my game! You can do whatever you want as long as the principal doesn't see what you're doing! Listen for his whistles to know when he's nearby.

I heard t- Wait, who set off that alarm? - The alarm clock item throws me off pretty easily... If I hear that, I'll likely go investiagte that over other noises I've heard. Tick tock, I'm going to the clock, hahahaa!

Use detention to your advantage! - If I'm about to tag you, sometimes getting sent to detention is a good way to get away!

BSODA is a BLAST! - You can not only spray *me* with BSODA to push me away, but you can spray my friends away as well!

Playtime? More like "Get-away" time! - If Playtime sees you, she'll surely chase you! However, if you can escape her sight while she's chasing you, she'll forget you were ever there and wander randomly. If you're lucky, she'll wander away from you!

Bully Blocks the way - It's a Bully will take an item when you pass him, but did you know he'll block your path if you don't have any items at all? He doesn't block mine, of course! He's also so big, people (myself included) can't see past him!

Have fun! - Have fun!

Now for a fun time lesson from yours truly, Baldi!: Did you know that you can visit me on the World Wide Web? That's right! Grab a parent or guardian and go to www.baldisbasics.org to find out more!

Finally, I just want to say thank you! I hope this game makes your day, because you've surely made mine!
